ðŸŽ¯Project Goals:
i.) Analyze the impact of genres and developers on game ratings.
ii.) Identify key factors that influence user ratings.
iii.) Provide actionable insights for game developers.

ðŸ”§ Approach & Methods:
1.) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Visualized ratings distribution and relationships between genres and developers.
2.) Statistical Analysis: 
Conducted ANOVA tests to identify significant differences in ratings.
3.) Regression Analysis: 
Built a multiple linear regression model to predict game ratings based on genre and developer data.

ðŸŒŸ Key Findings:
a.) Genres and Developers Matter: 
Significant differences in ratings across genres and developers, with genres like Strategy and developers like Supercell leading the pack.
b.) Weak Correlations: 
Genre and developer influence ratings, but other factors are crucial for a comprehensive understanding.
c.) Model Insights: 
Regression model highlights the need for more features to improve prediction accuracy. 

ðŸ’¥Impact
These insights guide developers to focus on high-rating genres and successful developers, emphasizing the importance of innovative game features and comprehensive market analysis.
